PART1: CREATING SNAPSHOTS
--what is git ?
	control version system
	main goals: track history & collaboration
	distributed vs centralized systems
	GIT is distributed
	Pros: free, open source, fast, scalable, cheap branching/merging
	
--git workflow
	if we delete a file we must stage it too
	you can commit your code without staging
	ignoring files 
	git mv | gir cp 
	
--commiting best practices
	commit often: don't mix commit changes (i.e: bug fix & typo)
	wording: every commit must have a meaningful name "fixed a bug" "fix the bug"
	
--.gitignore
	samples of files you need to ignore when working with java: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Java.gitignore
	
	
--viewing a commit & git objects 
	commits
	blobs (files)
	trees (directories)
	tags
	
--unstaging files 
	you can restore files from the staging area 
	GIT handles this with two approaches:
	approach 1: takes the last copy from the last snapshot an puts it in the working directory incase it exists (modified)
	approach2: git kayakhd the newled added file mn staging area w kaydiro fi the working directory bhala yalah zadnah (newely added)
	
--dsicarding local changes 
	chi mrat we want to undo local changes 
	example zadna chi file walakin mabghinahch yt tracka 
	git clean -df newaddedfile.js
	
--restoring files to an earlier version 
	chi mrat we want to restore chi files
	par defaut nqadro rajeoh mn last snapshot wla last commit 
	hna kanradoh mn chi commit (git restore --source="HEAD~1 filename")
	
--creating snapshots with vscode
	we can work with git via vscode 
	
--creating snapshot with gitKraken
	we can work with git graphically via vscode 
	
	
--PART2: BROWSING HISTORY
	search for commits 	
	view a commit 
	
	restore your project to an earlier version 
		when we are at DETACHED HEAD STATE we should only look up code and make an experimental changes 
		
	comapare commits 
	view the history of a file
	find a bad commit that introduced a bug 
	
	
--PART3: branching
	use branches 
	compare branches 
	merge branches 
	resolve conflics
	undo a faulty merge 
	essential tools (stashing, cherry picking)
	
	
--PART4: collaboration 
	collaboration workflows
	pushing, fetching and pulling
	pull requests, issues and milestones
	contributing to open source projects
