DEV STEPS:
    - Create UserDetailsService & SecurityConfigurer
    - Authenticate an Endpoint
    - Add JWT dependencies and create JWT util class
    - Add RequestInput & ResponseOutput objects for the /authenticate endpoint
    - handle /authenticate endpoint in the controller
        . authenticate the request with Authentication manager
        . generate JWT for the authenticated user
        . return the Response with the user that is: Authenticated + has JWT token
    - allow access to all in spring configurer
    - allow spring security to listen to every request that has an authorization header that had a JWT token in it
        . extract JWT from the header
        . validate and set it in execution context
        How ? with Servlet Filters

    - tell spring configurer about the filter
        . make session management STATELESS
        . add the custom created filter before the default one
